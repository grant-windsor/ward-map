# ward-map
Ward Map will make it easy for leaders in the bishopric, elders quorum, and relief society to keep track of who is living where.

Leaders should be able to click on a house or apartment to see and edit its information.

They should also be able to add and remove houses and apartments.

It would be really great to have a way to filter out and get only the relief society or elders quorum.

It would be nice to have a way to differentiate 'inactive properties' or places with no ward members, but that could potentially house ward members in the future.

It would be really great to have a way to highlight properties, to show where there are struggling or inactive.

It must be well documented so that after I move out of the ward it can continue to be worked on by others.

The project needs to be able to be run in a webpage. Probably the 229 ward website.
